# dalle_hidden_words
A brief alphabet shows the correspondence between the self-created words by dalle to english
There remains no steady proof that AI image generators like DALLE can slowly evolve a lauguage for itself based on millions of generation actions, 
but through https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00169, the author has actually found some words that correspondent to English, like "Apoploe vesrreaitais" means birds,
and "Wa ch zod rea" means seafood.
I was greatly inspired and since then, I was beginning to find more "hidden words" of DALLE, and hope to find whether it has developed its own language.
The task is hard and uncertain, though with some real mind-blowing discoveries shoen in the alphabet.
